Module-01-Challenge
This first challenge wasn't too bad.  Took a while to get started.  Also a few more examples of more complex code comments would be beneficial.  I seem to struggle with what to write.  So I just write what CSS styles are doing.  
Not sure what you mean about Screenshots?  
I assuming that the URL you want is: https://github.com/JenHavron/Module-01-Challenge.git (but if you are in git aready then you already have it.)
Git was much better this time around. Or at least I thought it was.  We will see if you have problems opening it.
